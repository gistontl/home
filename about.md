## Research

### Optical Nano-Technology

Guiding of light at nanometer beam sizes possess many potential applications in the next generation of optical communications and circuit. Nanometer scale integrated optical circuits is being investigated to realize the replacement for the existing electronic circuits. Light beam at nanometer scale would facilitate for the fabrication of smaller semiconductor structure and give the famous Moore law a much longer last. Those kind of devices is being actively studied.

### Specialty Optical Fibers and Applications

Specialty optical fibers are most essential component in optical communication and sensors for fabricating range of optical devices such as optical fiber lasers and amplifiers, dispersion-compensator, and optical sensors. These optical devices can then be used for biomedical applications, long-haul telecommunication, health monitoring of huge civil infrastructures as well as oil and gas applications. We design and fabricate different types of specialty fibers in our laboratory, such as polarization-maintaining optical fibers, microstructured optical fibers for specific applications, nonlinear optical fiber, and photosensitive fibers for Bragg gratings.

**Symbolic Computing Package** ([Homepage](http://symbcomp.gist.ac.kr))

The Symbolic Computing Package is an add-on package that facilitates symbolic computation in Mathematica. It enables display and interpretation of derivatives, vector operators and brakets using the traditional notation based on the low-level box language and contains over 700 user-defined functions for notation, manipulation and evaluation of various mathematical expressions.

**GMES** ([Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmes/))

GMES is a free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation Python package developed at GIST to model photonic devices. Its features include simulation in 1D, 2D, and 3D Cartesian coordinates, distributed memory parallelism on any system supporting the MPI standard, portable to any Unix-like system, variuos dispersive ε(ω) models, CPML absorbing boundaries and/or Bloch-periodic boundary conditions, and arbitrary material and source distributions. GMES officially stands for GIST Maxwell’s Equations Solver.

**Vector FEM** ([Github](http://github.com/gistontl/vfem))

Photonic crystal fibers have attracted growing attention over the past few years because of their ability to offer manipulation in optical properties of light. Such as high-birefringence (HB) exceeding 10^-3 can be straightforwardly attained in PCFs using the design flexibility and the large index contrast. However, manipulation of optical properties is often accompanied with high confinement and propagation losses. A solution to the tradeoff between achieving the desire optical characteristics and the confinement loss lies in the numerical simulation for seeking suitable design and material parameters. Vector Finite element method (VFEM) is one of the best numerical techniques for modeling and simulation of PCF. We have developed an in-house mode-solver based on VFEM for numerical simulation and analysis of the guiding properties of the PCF. As an example, Fig. 1 shows the mesh of a particular design of a PCF and its simulated electric field patterns for fundamental core mode and a higher-order cladding mode.

**Bigboy** ([Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bigboy/))

Bigboy is a free program, an implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods. It is designed to study the photonic device consists of dispersive material. Bigboy’s features include: 3D computations, a flexible interactive user interface based upon the GNU Guile scripting language, and output in HDF5 format. It is portable to most Unix-like systems, and supports parallel environment using MPI.
