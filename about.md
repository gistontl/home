## Research

### Optical Nano-Technology

Guiding of light at nanometer beam sizes possess many potential applications in the next generation of optical communications and circuit. Nanometer scale integrated optical circuits is being investigated to realize the replacement for the existing electronic circuits. Light beam at nanometer scale would facilitate for the fabrication of smaller semiconductor structure and give the famous Moore law a much longer last. Those kind of devices is being actively studied.

### Development of Scientific Softwares

We develop various calculation and simulation tools.

**Symbolic Computing Package** ([Homepage](http://symbcomp.gist.ac.kr))

The Symbolic Computing Package is an add-on package that facilitates symbolic computation in Mathematica. It enables display and interpretation of derivatives, vector operators and brakets using the traditional notation based on the low-level box language and contains over 700 user-defined functions for notation, manipulation and evaluation of various mathematical expressions.

**GMES** ([Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmes/))

GMES is a free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation Python package developed at GIST to model photonic devices. Its features include simulation in 1D, 2D, and 3D Cartesian coordinates, distributed memory parallelism on any system supporting the MPI standard, portable to any Unix-like system, variuos dispersive ε(ω) models, CPML absorbing boundaries and/or Bloch-periodic boundary conditions, and arbitrary material and source distributions. GMES officially stands for GIST Maxwell’s Equations Solver.

**Vector FEM** ([Github](http://github.com/gistontl/vfem))

To design and optimize various types of the optical fiber and nanometer-scale waveguide devices, development of simulation tools through the various regimes is being undertaken. Using these simulation tools, optimum parameters that determine properties of the optical fiber and fiber-based devices or subwavelength waveguides can be determined.

**Bigboy** ([Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bigboy/))

Bigboy is a free program, an implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods. It is designed to study the photonic device consists of dispersive material. Bigboy’s features include: 3D computations, a flexible interactive user interface based upon the GNU Guile scripting language, and output in HDF5 format. It is portable to most Unix-like systems, and supports parallel environment using MPI.
