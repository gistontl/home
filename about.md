## Introduction of Lab.

The research areas of Optical Nano Technology Lab cover development of various optical devices and systems based on optical fibers and optical fiber gratings such as fiber sensors, fiber lasers and novel optical sources. The research efforts include both experimental and theoretical investigations. Fabrication of optical fibers and optical fiber gratings is done using MCVD system, draw tower and various types of lasers. Optical fiber sensors for structural monitoring are being developed and generation of correlated photon pairs using photonic crystal fibers for quantum information processing is being investigated. For simulation of nano-scale devices and for the research on grid computing, a high performance computing system employing 106-node cluster is being used in collaboration with the research teams in other institutions.

### Specialty Optical Fibers and Applications

**Fabrication of the Optical Fiber Bragg Gratings**

The existing fabrication schemes for optical fiber Bragg gratings are roughly categorized into: 1) single-beam internal method, 2) dual-beam holographic method, 3) phase-mask photolithographic method, and 4) point-by-point fabrication method. Implementation of these various fabrication techniques is investigated at the same time as exploration of novel fabrication schemes.

**Wavelength Converters**

Wavelength conversion using cross-gain modulation (XGM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM) in erbium-doped fiber is being studied. Unlike the conventional method employing semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), the EDF-based wavelength converter has the potential for high signal-to-noise ratio and cost effectiveness.

**Multiwavelength Lasers**

We are conducting fabrication and characterization of a multiwavelength fiber laser for DWDM applications using cascaded long-period fiber gratings (LPFGs) as the multichannel filter. The characteristics of the laser are primarily determined by the LPFGs, and research is being conducted for more lasing wavelengths and denser channel spacing.

**Development of Applications of the Fiber Bragg Grating**

For realization of the applications and devices with the desired characteristics using optical fiber Bragg gratings, research is being conducted on development of the optical fiber devices, e.g., dispersion compensator, reflection-type filter, optical resonator cavity, and measurement of the characteristics data.

### Optical Device Simulations

We develop various calculation and simulation tools for a optical/photonic device.

**Lab-made Optical Device Simulation Tools**

To design and optimize various types of the optical fiber and nanometer-scale waveguide devices, development of simulation tools through the various regimes is being undertaken. Using these simulation tools, optimum parameters that determine properties of the optical fiber and fiber-based devices or subwavelength waveguides can be determined.

**Bigboy**

Bigboy is a free program, an implementation of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods. It is designed to study the photonic device consists of dispersive material. Bigboy’s features include: 3D computations, a flexible interactive user interface based upon the GNU Guile scripting language, and output in HDF5 format. It is portable to most Unix-like systems, and supports parallel environment using MPI.

### Optical Nano-Technology

Guiding of light at nanometer beam sizes possess many potential applications in the next generation of optical communications and circuit. Nanometer scale integrated optical circuits is being investigated to realize the replacement for the existing electronic circuits. Light beam at nanometer scale would facilitate for the fabrication of smaller semiconductor structure and give the famous Moore law a much longer last. Those kind of devices is being actively studied.
